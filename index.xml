      <description>Hi!&#xA;I am Katya and I&amp;rsquo;ve been working as a data scientist for the last ten years. My big dream is making data science and analytics accessible to everyone in their daily lives and passions. In this blog I will share my learnings and provide simple non-cliche examples on the techniques and algorithms that I use in my work.&#xA;My other passion is cooking and eating tasty food. I love cookbooks, the history of food and learning about national cuisines.</description>
